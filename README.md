# DATA SET: 
[National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov)

The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) is under the jurisdiction of the United States government and contains over 60 petabytes of climate, coastal, oceanic, atmospheric and geological data. The NCEI has a variety of applications, the most obvious being climate research, weather forecasting, and oceanography. Other applications include agriculture, in which farmers may rely on weather/climate data to determine when to plant their crops, or energy and utilities, such as solar or wind, which heavily depend on weather/climate data. Overall, data from the NCEI is valuable and essential for any industry that can be heavily influenced by weather or climate conditions.

# Data Science Book: 
[Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything](http://www.freetechbooks.com/disruptive-possibilities-how-big-data-changes-everything-t1123.html)

The book I am interested in is Jeffery Needham’s  Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything. This book caught my attention because it covers the impacts big data has on technology, business, and society in general. Being published in 2013, a decade in the past, I think it would be interesting to read about what was then seen as the revolutionary potential of big data, and compare these ideas to our reality now in 2023. I think there is still value to reading books like this one that are not as recent because they provide a starting place, for someone like myself who is new to the big data industry, to understand the early ideas on big data’s potential impacts on how we interact with the world around us.
